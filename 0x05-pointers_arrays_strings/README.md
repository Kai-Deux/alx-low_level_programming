# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
0. Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
    - Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *
1. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
	- Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
2. Write a function that returns the length of a string.
	- Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
	- Prototype: void _puts(char *str);
4. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
	- Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);
5. Write a function that reverses a string.
	- Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);
6. Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
	- Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
	- Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
	- The function should print the second half of the string
	- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2
